This is an example to run WiLiKi inside Makiki server.

To run the server, invoke makiki-wiliki in this directory:

  gosh ./makiki-wiliki --port <port>

The current directory matter, for the wiliki data dbm is created there.

Once the server starts, you can access it via
http://localhost:<port>/makiki-wiliki.cgi
